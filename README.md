# Weighted-Faceoff

My project attempting to create a weighted faceoff metric for the NHL. Full article is avaliable on my Medium account.

WeightedFaceoff.R contains all the code for this project. It includes filtering the dataset into subsets for faceoffs and seasons, creating a weighting system and applying
it to all players in the dataset above the median, and merging dataframes to create tables to compare normal faceoff percentages (NFP's) to weighted faceoff percentages (WFP's). 

The code starts with the process for the 2023-24 NHL season then repeates itself for the two prior NHL seasons (2021-2022 & 2022-2023). 

There are also screenshots of the visualizations (tables and graphs) that are used in the Medium article, created in the WeightedFaceoff.R file.
